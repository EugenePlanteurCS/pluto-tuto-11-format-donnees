# Tutorial: Geospatial Data Formats

Geospatial data allows the communication of information in a wide range of fields. Over time, many data formats have emerged to support this diversity. This tutorial introduces these various formats, their evolution, their advantages and disadvantages, and provides guidance on how and in which contexts to use them most effectively. It will be divided into four jupyter notebooks:

1) [Raster formats](./raster_formats.ipynb)
2) [Vector formats](./vector_data_formats.ipynb)
3) Data cube formats (or multi-dimensional raster)
4) Cloud-optimized formats
